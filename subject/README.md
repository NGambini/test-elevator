# The Elevator

A programming test by Wopata.

## The job

Your job is to write the controlling logic board of an elevator in Angular.JS.
It is a completely standard elevator you surely have operated numerous times in
your life, so the way it works should be instantly familiar.

We have written a framework to display what's going on and to call and operate
the car. The rest is up to you.

We recommend you to fork this repository and work on Github. It is just as fine
to clone it and push it on Bitbucket instead. The choice of git provider does
not affect the evaluation of the solution.

## Your tasks

* Needless to say, write tests to test your code. And ours.


## Notes

* The elevator has double doors: the car has a manual _inner door_ to be
  operated by the occupant, and each floor has an _outer door_ that should be
  locked by the system whenever the car is not stationary at the given floor.

* An unoccupied car can be called irregardless of its inner door status.
