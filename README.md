Subject can be seen here : https://github.com/steerio/the-elevator or in /subject.
I ported the Code to Angular 2.

Tech used : 
* Angular 2 
* Typescript
* Webpack
* ng2-translate
* Material2

## Features

* Localization and lang switching
* Uses local storage to store user lang
* Material Design
* Dependency Injection : choose your algorithm in app/app.module.ts file

## Installation

* Make sure you have the latest version of node & npm.
* npm install (in the project folder)
* npm install weback-dev-server typings -g
* start the project with webpack-dev-server --content-base dist/
* If using VS Code, you can just do CTRL+SHIFT+B
* Project is then served on http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

## Todo

* Add more algorithms
* Persist current floor and request list in local storage
* Better toolbar UI
